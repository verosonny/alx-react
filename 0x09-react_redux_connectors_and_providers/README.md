### Redux Connectors and How to Use Them:

Redux connectors, often referred to as `connect` from the `react-redux` library, are higher-order components that provide a way to connect your React components to the Redux store.

#### How to Use Connectors:
1. **Import `connect`:**
   ```javascript
   import { connect } from 'react-redux';
   ```

2. **Define mapStateToProps:**
   - `mapStateToProps` is a function that maps the Redux state to props that will be available in your component.
   ```javascript
   const mapStateToProps = state => ({
     prop: state.someReducer.someProp
   });
   ```

3. **Define mapDispatchToProps (Optional):**
   - `mapDispatchToProps` is a function that maps action creators to props, allowing components to dispatch actions.
   ```javascript
   const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
     someAction: () => dispatch(someAction())
   });
   ```

4. **Connect Component:**
   - Use `connect` to connect your component to the Redux store.
   ```javascript
   export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(YourComponent);
   ```

### Functions to Pass to a Connector:

#### 1. mapStateToProps:
- Maps the Redux state to props in your component.

#### 2. mapDispatchToProps:
- Maps action creators to props, allowing components to dispatch actions.

### Mapping Action Creators to a Component using a Connector:

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { someAction } from './actions';

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  prop: state.someReducer.someProp
});

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  someAction: () => dispatch(someAction())
});

const YourComponent = ({ prop, someAction }) => {
  // Use prop and someAction in your component
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(YourComponent);
```

### Mapping Async Action Creators to a Component with Redux Thunk:

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchSomeData } from './actions';

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  data: state.data
});

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  fetchData: () => dispatch(fetchSomeData())
});

const YourComponent = ({ data, fetchData }) => {
  // Use data and fetchData in your component
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(YourComponent);
```

### Redux Providers and Setting Up Your App's Store:

#### Redux Provider:
- A React component that provides the Redux store to the entire application.
- Wrap your root component with `Provider` and pass the Redux store as a prop.

#### Setting Up Store:
- Create a Redux store using `createStore` from `redux` and combine reducers if needed.

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <YourRootComponent />
  </Provider>
);
```

### Improving a Connector's Performance Using Reselect:

Reselect is a library for creating memoized selectors to improve the performance of your Redux selectors.

### Using Redux Dev Tools to Debug the State of Your Application:

Redux DevTools Extension allows you to inspect the Redux store, track actions, and debug your application's state changes.

These are essential concepts and tools for working with Redux in a React application, providing efficient state management and debugging capabilities.
