# Immutable.js Usage Example

This repository provides examples of how to use [Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/) in real-life scenarios. Immutable.js is a library that provides immutable data structures, making it easier to manage state in applications, preventing accidental mutations, and enhancing predictability.

## React State Management

The [React State Management](./react-state-management) example demonstrates how to use Immutable.js in a React component to manage state in a safe and predictable manner. Immutable Lists are used to represent a list of todos, showcasing the benefits of immutability in a React context.

## Redux State Management

The [Redux State Management](./redux-state-management) example illustrates the use of Immutable.js within a Redux application. The reducer function employs Immutable Maps to handle state updates, ensuring that the state remains immutable and facilitating a cleaner data flow.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Next.js

The [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Next.js](./ssr-nextjs) example showcases the use of Immutable.js when working with server-side rendering in a Next.js application. Immutable Lists are utilized to maintain the immutability of data received from the server during rendering.
